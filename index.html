        <h2> Updated specification</h2>
        <h3> May 9th - 2024</h3>
        Based on feedback from our initial project specification, we have decided to make smaller changes and larger clarifications to our project idea. As most of the tank was animated in the lab, we decided to lean into the particle and light effects.  

        This was written down with a background, problem statement, and thoughts on how we would implement these changes into a document. This document can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/Emir-Catir-and-Robin-Claesson/DH2323-Project-Blog/blob/main/resources/DH2323_Project_Specification.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <h2> Intial project idea and specification</h2>
        <h3> April 30 - 2024</h3>
        Our idea for the project was to extend the work we did in animation track lab 3, to make the entire scene more dynamic. 
        As our initial project specification, we decided to include:
        <ul>
            <li> Animations for the tank </li>
            <li>Dust particle effects from driving on the sand </li>
            <li>“Tire marks” in the sand from driving on it</li>
            <li>Particle effects on firing the laser</li>
            <li>Light effects from explosions and weapons </li>  
        </ul> 

        Below is an initial sketch of our project idea:
